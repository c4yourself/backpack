Back-to-BackPack
================

The Back-to-BackPack is a children’s education game, with a similar way of
learning as the classic game Backpacker, with additional added features to
make it interactive for the players.

The Back-to-BackPack game is basically a question game, with questions in
different categories ranging from _Mathematics_ to _Local geography_. The player
travels from city to city, gaining both coins and experience, starting off as a
first grader (level 1) and going up the grades with increased experience, by
answering questions in different school subjects. The coins and experience can
be used to unlock new means of travelling and new cities. Kids will learn by
travelling the world and by answering questions and they will be rewarded titles
such as _Mathematical Genius_. When playing online the players will also be able
to see high score lists with players from e.g. a specific country, city or search
their friends' nicknames.

This way the learning process will be more fun and interesting for the kids as
they develop their own characters within the game.
